This was based on multiple sources that were found.

The program should just require a run of make which will run SDCC.
See included Makefile for more details on setup of SDCC.

If you find the Makefile confusing you can just run 
sdcc ezusbledtoggle.c

Problems you may run into:
make sure sdcc is in your path
